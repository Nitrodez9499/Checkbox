# My Projects 🚀

Welcome to **My Projects** — a personal collection of coding experiments, learning projects, and side builds. This repo showcases what I'm working on as I grow my skills in programming, math, and problem-solving.

## 🔍 About This Repository

This repository includes a variety of projects, such as:

- Web tools and utilities
- Python scripts and automation
- Math-based projects and visualizations
- Data analysis or machine learning experiments
- Personal study projects and prototypes

Each folder is its own project with code, notes, and possibly a short write-up or `README.md` file.

✅ Why I Made This
	•	To keep track of what I’ve built
	•	To experiment with new ideas, tools, and languages
	•	To apply what I’m learning in school and on my own
	•	To build a portfolio over time for college or internships

🛠️ Tools and Tech I Use

Depending on the project, I might be using:
	•	Languages: Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
	•	Tools: Git, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, Flask (sometimes)
	•	Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask, etc.

🧠 Topics I’m Exploring
	•	Python and scripting
	•	Web development basics
	•	Data analysis and visualization
	•	Simple machine learning concepts
	•	Math logic and problem-solving
